mysqlnd_ms_query_is_select -- Find whether to send the query to the master,
the slave or the last used MySQL server

  int mysqlnd_ms_query_is_select(string query)~

Finds whether to send the query to the master, the slave or the last used
MySQL server.

The plugins built-in read/write split mechanism will be used to analyze the
query string to make a recommendation where to send the query. The built-in
read/write split mechanism is very basic and simple. The plugin will recommend
sending all queries to the MySQL replication master server but those which
begin with SELECT, or begin with a SQL hint which enforces sending the query
to a slave server. Due to the basic but fast algorithm the plugin may propose
to run some read-only statements such as SHOW TABLES on the replication
master.

Query string to test.

A return value of MYSQLND_MS_QUERY_USE_MASTER indicates that the query should
be send to the MySQL replication master server. The function returns a value
of MYSQLND_MS_QUERY_USE_SLAVE if the query can be run on a slave because it is
considered read-only. A value of MYSQLND_MS_QUERY_USE_LAST_USED is returned to
recommend running the query on the last used server. This can either be a
MySQL replication master server or a MySQL replication slave server.

|mysqlnd_ms_query_is_select| example

<?php >
  function is_select($query)
  {
   switch (mysqlnd_ms_query_is_select($query))
   {
    case MYSQLND_MS_QUERY_USE_MASTER:
     printf("'%s' should be run on the master.\n", $query);
     break;
    case MYSQLND_MS_QUERY_USE_SLAVE:
     printf("'%s' should be run on a slave.\n", $query);
     break;
    case MYSQLND_MS_QUERY_USE_LAST_USED:
     printf("'%s' should be run on the server that has run the previous query\n", $query);
     break;
    default:
     printf("No suggestion where to run the '%s', fallback to master recommended\n", $query);
     break;
   }
  }
  
  is_select("INSERT INTO test(id) VALUES (1)");
  is_select("SELECT 1 FROM DUAL");
  is_select("/*" . MYSQLND_MS_LAST_USED_SWITCH . "*/SELECT 2 FROM DUAL");
?>

The above example will output:

  INSERT INTO test(id) VALUES (1) should be run on the master.
  SELECT 1 FROM DUAL should be run on a slave.
  /*ms=last_used*/SELECT 2 FROM DUAL should be run on the server that has run the previous query
