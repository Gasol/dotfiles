## This is the .tcshrc.alias file, part of the TCSHRC project
## at http://tcshrc.sourceforge.net

## Standard aliases - security
# "-i" asks for confirmation when deleting. This is good.
# In the "dangerous" section there are aliases for non-confirmation.
alias rm 	'rm -v -i'
alias cp 	'cp -v -i'
alias mv 	'mv -v -i'

## Standard aliases - CPM/MSDOS heritage
alias del   	'rm -v -i'
alias cls   	'clear'
# "-p" lets you create a path structure with one command, ex. mkdir -p /a/b/c
alias md    	'mkdir -v -p'
alias rd    	'rmdir -v'

## Standard aliases - convenience
# Color syntax
alias ls 	'ls --color'
# Typicaly "more" does not allow you to use the arrow keys/etc for navigation.
# Thus, we try to use "less", if it exists. Some distros do not put the
# fileutils package and it is annoying if the alias exists without the app.
if ( -e `where less` ) then
	alias more 	'less'
endif
# To be used as in "cp /etc/inetd.conf /etc/inetd.conf.`today`"
alias today 	"date '+%d%h%y'"
# As in "Message Less", use it on a free terminal to see the logs as they come.
alias mess 	'clear ; tail -f /var/log/messages'
# The following was removed because standard installations of Linux do not
# install "vi-enhanced" by default. This lead to the situtation that
# "vi" was not working even though it was there...
# Plain "vi" does not support syntax highlighting and other tricks. 
# We check if vim is installed, then set. Sorry non-vim users.
if ( -e `where vim`) then
	alias vi 	'vim'
endif
# Pressing "x" and enter exits.
alias x     	'exit'
# Quite handy, type "ff test.c" to find "test.c". 
# Keep in mind that there is also "locate test.c" which is faster.
alias ff    	'find . -name $*'
# Alias for "." and ".."
# Shows current directory
alias . 	'pwd'
# Goes back one directory
alias .. 	'cd ..'
alias ../	'cd ../'
# Goes back two directories
alias ... 	'cd ../..'
alias .../	'cd ../../'
# Goes to previous directory
alias -		'cd -'
# Goes to the root directory
alias /		'cd /'

# The following are not generic enough. Disabled for the moment.
#alias vt    	'tar tvf'
#alias xt    	'tar xvf'
#alias ct    	'tar cvf'
#alias zv    	'unzip -v'
#alias zt    	'unzip -t'
#alias restart 	'clear ; exec tcsh'

## Standard aliases - for typos
# These are the most common typos made by users, even experienced ones.
# Send me yours.
alias maek  'make'
alias alais 'alias'
alias csl   'clear'
alias sl    'ls --color'

## Aliases specific to TCSH
# What is the help command? Type "ls" and hit F1. Will show a help line.
# From version tcshrc-1.x we use the man page facility as the help source.
# Once you read the help, press "q" to quit and you can continue editing the
# line.
#alias helpcommand whatis
alias helpcommand man

############# WATCH OUT THIS ONE #############################
# This is handy but dangerous!
# To erase a directory structure, use "mrm openssl-0.9.5a".
# It will be erased, no questions asked.
# The "\" in the command disabled any further aliases encountered.
##### To enable this command, uncomment the following.
#alias mrm   	'\rm -fr'

## Custom aliases - I can put whatever here
## These are handy to run on a console virtual console.
# The tcpdump line is nice to see what traffic goes on the network
# -s 2000  means to grab all the packet (max is about 1500, but anyway..)
# -n  means do not resolve names. Makes it faster and lightweight.
# -i eth0  means only the Ethernet interface. In some distros, the loopback is
# shown too which clutters the output.
alias log_tcpdump 'clear ; exec tcpdump -s 2000 -n -i eth0'

# This is a console lock. -a means that the user cannot switch consoles,
# needs to unlock this console to continue. Before using this, check that
# the SysRq linux kernel combination is disabled. If not, users may be able to 
# to kill the "vlock" process and access the other terminals.
alias log_lock 'clear; exec vlock -a'

# Put the following on a free console and leave it there.
# Even when the logs are circulating, it will carry on.
# If someone kills this process, it automatically exits due to the "exec".
alias log_messages 'clear; exec tail -f /var/log/messages --follow=name --retry'

# This creates a PostScript file out of a .txt one, in a economic way.
# the output file is "output.ps" in all cases (carefull with overwrites..)
# You need the "enscript" package installed.
# It sets Duplex mode, prints in landscape two pages on each side of the
# paper.
alias enscriptit 'enscript -o output.ps -DDuplex:true -DTumble:true -r -M A4 -2'

# If you are on Sourceforge, this may be handy. Also try RSA authentication
# so that you do not need to put a password to connect. It is also handy with
# "scp".
# You can run it as "shell1 -l my_username" without modifying the following.
alias shell1 'slogin -x shell1.sourceforge.net -l CHANGE_WITH_YOUR_USERNAME_IN_.tcshrc.alias'

# This is another way to get RFCs nicely. Just do "rfcget 1234" 
# to get the appropriate RFC. Needs the ncftp package.
alias rfcget 'ncftpget ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc\!^.txt' 

# This erases the backup files from emacs, vi (if enabled) and others.
# It is disabled by default.
#alias clean 'rm -f  *~'
# This is useful to translators checking .po files.
alias msgcheck 'msgfmt -o /dev/null --statistics --strict --verbose'
